## About The Project

Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy where two correlated assets are traded based on their price spread. Instead of using a **fixed hedge ratio**, this project utilizes a **Kalman filter** in order to dynamically adjust the hedge ratio over time. This allows for **more accurate and adaptive trading decisions**.

### **Why Use a Kalman Filter?**
- Traditional pairs trading assumes a fixed hedge ratio (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares regression).
- However, in real markets, stock relationships **change over time**.
- A **Kalman filter** helps us continuously **update** the hedge ratio, improving trading accuracy.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**: Fetches stock price data from Bloomberg.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans data, removes missing values, and normalizes prices.
3. **Dynamic Hedge Ratio Estimation**: Uses the Kalman filter to adjust hedge ratios in real-time.
4. **Trading Signals**:
   - If the spread is **too wide**, we **bet on it returning to normal**.
   - If the spread is **too narrow**, we **exit the trade**.
5. **Backtesting**: Simulates past trades to evaluate strategy performance.
